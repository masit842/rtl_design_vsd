gate level simulation
  running the test bench with netlist as deesign under test
  netlist is logically same as rtl code
same test bench will align with the design

why gls
  verify the logical correctness afterr synthesys
  ensuring the timing of the design is met.

gls using verilog
                                               ________
design ----------------------------------->   |         |
gatelevel verilog models------------------>   |iverilog | ----------> vcd file -----------> gtkwave 
test bench ------------------------------->   |_________|


synthesys simulation mismatch
    missing sensitivity list


blocking and non-blocking statements in verilog
  blocking
    this comes when we use the always block
    it executes as the order 
    first statement first annd second statement second

  non-blocking
    executed allthe rhs when always block is entered
    paralal evaluation
